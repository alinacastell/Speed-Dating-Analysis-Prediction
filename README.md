# Speed-Dating-Analysis-and-Prediction

Over the years, humans have continued to evolve being driven by one basic instinct: reproduction. That is, in fact, the basis of the survival of humankind and the reason why, at some point in our lives, we might find ourselves looking for a partner.

However, this couple-seeking process has developed just as much as society has: from courtship to dating apps, partner choosing as we know it is nothing like it used to be. But behind every date, or every Tinder match, could there still be a pattern? Could our partner choices be in fact much more predictable than we believe them to be?
Let us use Machine Learning to find out.

Our purpose is to see if we can predict whether two separate individuals will fancy each other or not, based on our prior knowledge about them (including, but not being limited to, traits such as gender, age, race, studies...). In short, we will answer the question: Can we predict attraction through data?

To do so, we will be working on the dataset Speeddating, which was released in 2004 by Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from the Columbia Business School, gathering the data from a series of speed dating events from 2002-2004. The dataset file was obtained from the OpenML repository, which can be checked in the Reference section.

In these 4 minutes dates, participants were asked to rank their dates based on several attributes and to conclude whether they would consider them to be a match or not.

More specifically, the focus of this paper is to determine whether attributes such as gender or race are influential when it comes to choosing a partner and, most importantly, what aspects are most valued in a partner.
